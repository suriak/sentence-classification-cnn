## Sentence Classification Using CNN Through Keras on Tensorflow
This project implements the method proposed by Yoon Kim for sentence classification in his paper [**Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) 

The implementaion is experimented with TREC data set using [*GloVe pre-trained vectors*](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip). Here, the attempt is to implement the *CNN-static* version explained in the paper with some changes to the hyper-parameters.
